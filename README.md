## üîç **What's Inside?**

### **1. Infrared (IR)**
A curated collection of IR signal files for testing and experimenting with devices like remotes or IR-controlled systems. These files can help you analyze, recreate, and understand IR signal transmission.

### **2. Sub-GHz Protocols**
Explore Sub-GHz communication with files and configurations designed for interacting with older wireless systems, bypassing locks (in controlled environments), and analyzing obscure frequencies.

### **3. Bad USB & BLE**
Scripts for experimenting with USB devices and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Learn how USB and BLE vulnerabilities can be exploited to test payloads and interactions. Always use these in **controlled environments** with proper permissions.

### **4. Evil Portals**
Prebuilt templates for creating custom captive portals. Ideal for understanding phishing tactics, network redirection, or testing user behavior in a secure and controlled setup.

### **5. Tutorials**
A knowledge hub with detailed explanations of:
- **Wiring Diagrams:** Step-by-step instructions for connecting hardware like the M5Stick or other modules.
- **HackTutorials:** Topics like WiFi Deauthentication, signal jamming, and wireless communication protocols to deepen your understanding.

### **6. MyProducts**
A unique showcase of how personal devices (e.g., purchased tools and gadgets) function, including their configurations and where they were sourced. This section provides practical examples of real-world applications.
