## Notes on Compatibility

- **Android Devices**: Some scripts may not function consistently on all Android devices due to variations in manufacturers' customizations (e.g., ColorOS on Oppo devices).
- **Cross-Compatibility**: Certain Windows-based scripts may work on Android devices if the commands overlap with shared functionalities (e.g., opening websites or taking screenshots).
